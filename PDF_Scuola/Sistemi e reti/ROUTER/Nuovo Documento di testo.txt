Introduction 
This document explains how to use the xmodem command at the console to download Cisco IOS® software using the ROM monitor (ROMmon). 

Prerequisites 
Requirements 
There are no specific requirements for this document.

Components Used 
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:

Cisco 827, 1600, 1700, 2600, 3600, and 3700 Series Routers 

Cisco AS5200, AS5300, AS5350, and AS5400 Universal Access Servers

Note: Xmodem can also be used on certain Catalyst switches. 

The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

Conventions 
Refer to Cisco Technical Tips Conventions for more information on document conventions.

Overview 
Xmodem can be used on a group of routers (see Components Used) and is used in disaster recovery situations where the router has no valid Cisco IOS software or bootflash image to boot from and hence, only boots up in ROMmon. This procedure can also be used where there are no Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) servers or network connections, and a direct PC connection (or through a modem connection) to the router's console is the only viable option. Because this procedure relies on the console speed of the router and the serial port of the PC, it can take a long time to download an image. For example, downloading Cisco IOS Software Release 12.1(16) IP Plus image to a Cisco 1600 Series Router using a speed of 38400 bps takes approximately 25 minutes.

Usage 
Here is the command syntax for xmodem as per the Command Reference Manual for Cisco IOS version 12.2. 

xmodem [-c] [-y] [-e] [-f] [-r] [-x] [-s data-rate]
This table describes the command syntax for the xmodem command.

syntax
 Description
 
-c 
 (Optional) CRC-16 checksumming, which is more sophisticated and thorough than standard checksumming. 
 
-y 
 (Optional) Uses the Ymodem protocol for higher throughput. 
 
-e 
 (Optional) Erases the first partition in Flash memory before starting the download. This option is only valid for the Cisco 1600 series. 
 
-f 
 (Optional) Erases all Flash memory before starting the download. This option is only valid for the Cisco 1600 series routers. 
 
-r 
 (Optional) Downloads the file to DRAM. The default is Flash memory. 
 
-x 
 (Optional) Does not execute the Cisco IOS software image on completion of the download. 
 
-s data-rate 
 (Optional) Sets the console port's data rate during file transfer. Values are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, and 115200 bps. The default rate is specified in the configuration register. This option is only valid for the Cisco 1600 series routers. 
 
filename 
 (Optional) Filename to copy. This argument is ignored when the -r keyword is specified since only one file can be copied to DRAM. On the Cisco 1600 series routers, files are loaded to the ROMmon for execution. 
 


Note:  xmodem options e, f, and s are only supported on the Cisco 1600 Series Routers. In order to find out the syntax and available options to use with the xmodem command, enter xmodem -? at the ROMmon prompt.

Here is an example of the xmodem command issued on a Cisco 1603 Router:

rommon 9 >xmodem -?
usage: xmodem [-cyrxefs]<destination filename>
-c  CRC-16
-y  ymodem-batch protocol
-r  copy image to dram for launch
-x  do not launch on download completion
-f  Perform full erase of flash
-e  Perform erase of first flash partition
-s<speed>Set speed of Download, where speed may be
1200|2400|4800|9600|19200|38400|115200Here is an example of the xmodem command issued on a Cisco 2620 Router:

rommon 1 >xmodem -?
xmodem: illegal option -- ?
usage: xmodem [-cyrx] <destination filename>
-c  CRC-16
-y  ymodem-batch protocol
-r  copy image to dram for launch
-x  do not launch on download completionExamples 
rommon 12 > xmodem -cfs115200 c1600-sy-mz.121-16.bin
rommon 2 > xmodem -c c2600-is-mz.122-10a.bin
Notes: 

The xmodem transfer only works on the console port. You can only download files to the router. You cannot use xmodem to get files from the router.

It is also important to note that the -sdata-rate option is only available on the Cisco 1600 Series Routers and was implemented to overcome the console baud rate limitation of 9600 bps. If you specify -sdata-rate of 115200 bps for example, you can increase the download rate and hence, reduce download time. Other Cisco routers support console speeds up to 115200 bps. Therefore, the -sdata-rate option is not required.

Ensure that the PC serial port is using a 16550 universal asynchronous transmitter/receiver (UART) if you are downloading a Cisco IOS software image through the router's console speed at 115200. If the PC serial port is not using a 16550 UART, it is recommended that you use a speed of 38,400 or lower.

Xmodem Procedure for Downloading a Cisco IOS Software Image onto a Cisco 1603 Router 
Use this xmodem procedure in order to download a Cisco IOS software image onto a Cisco 1603 Router.

Launch a terminal emulator program. 

In this example, configure Windows HyperTerminal for 8-N-1 at 9600 bps and connect your PC's serial port to the console port of the router. Once connected, you need to get into the ROMmon prompt (rommon 1>). Typically, if the router's Cisco IOS software image and bootflash image are both corrupt, the router only comes up in ROMmon mode. If the former is not true and you need to get into the ROMmon prompt, you need to change the configuration register (typically 0x2102 as given by show version) to 0x0: 

1600#configure term
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
1600(config)#configure
1600(config)#config-register 0x0
1600(config)#^Z

In this example, all Flash memory is erased before downloading using the f option (only on the Cisco 1600 Series ). Perform a CRC-16 checksum using the c option and using a download speed of 115200 bps (only on the Cisco 1600 Series ) by specifying -s115200:

This is done by closing the previous terminal session of 9600 bps and opening a new one at 115200 with 8-N-1. The trick here is that the Cisco 1603 only supports a maximum baud rate of 9600 bps. Therefore, when connecting at 115200 bps, you cannot see the router prompt. This is an important point to remember. Once connected to the router at 115200 bps, select Transfer and Send File from the HyperTerminal menu bar. 

 

Specify the image file name and location and enter xmodem as the protocol. 

 

Click on Send to start the transfer.

.........................Xmodem Procedure for Downloading a Cisco IOS Software Image onto a Cisco 3600 Router 
Use this xmodem procedure in order to download a Cisco IOS software image onto a Cisco 3600 Series Router.

The standard procedure uses the default console speed of 9600 bits per second. Xmodem is a slow transfer protocol, and the transfer of a file as large as a Cisco IOS software image could take an unacceptably long time. An increase to the console speed on the 3600 router helps decrease the time it takes to do the xmodem file transfer.

When in ROMMON mode, complete this procedure using the ROMMON confreg utility.

Thanks in advanceReply
Re: xmodem in cisco 3640ScottMac20-feb-2003 8.58Xmodem is not an automatic protocol.   You have to manually start the Xmodem transmit from the computer connected to the console (which must be running an Xmodem-capable terminal program (like HyperTem - Transfer|Send File| Xmodem)).   I think Xmodem 1K will also work, and is more efficient (1K blocks).   Good Luck   Scott  Reply

However when I try the "copy xmodem: flash:" command or "copy xmodem flash" I receive the error "xmodem:: permission denied".   I have searched and searched but can't find what the solution is to this. I suspect I may need to alter a config register but unsure of what to change it to etc.   Any help or suggestions greatly appreciated!Subscribe      Reply
Re: "xmodem:: permission denied" when...mohammedmahmoud4-mag-2007 23.27Hi,   Please follow this document to do the xmodem:   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/130/xmodem_generic.html   NOTE: Because this procedure relies on the console speed of the router and the serial port of the PC, it can take a long time to download an image.   HTH, please rate if it does help, Mohammed Mahmoud.  Reply
Re: "xmodem:: permission denied" when...cameron.moody5-mag-2007 16.26Hi Mohammed,   Thanks for the suggestion however I have also tried the xmodem command. When I do this I get an "unknown command" response.   Any other ideas that I can try? I am not concerned about how long it takes, I just need to get it up and running.Reply
Re: "xmodem:: permission denied" when...mohammedmahmoud6-mag-2007 0.51Hi,   It seems that the logic of the Cisco MC3810 Series recovery is different, kindly use follow this documet, and please don't hesitate for any further inquires:   You have to use the rommon 1> priv command to have access to the full set of ROM monitor commands.     http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/access/multicon/3810fru.htm     HTH, please do rate all helpful replies, Mohammed Mahmoud.

Re: "xmodem:: permission denied" when...jasonrandolph8-mag-2007 14.44Are you using hyperterm?

Re: "xmodem:: permission denied" when...sly0079-mag-2007 10.26Thanks for the assistance you have given on the use of Xmoden generic to download an IOS to the Router when it cannot be accessed. I have used it on 2600 series router and it has worked. However, before i could changed the baudrate to 9600, the final download had finished and the router restarted. How do I reset the baudrate back to 9600? I can only console into it right now at 115600. Reply
Re: "xmodem:: permission denied" when...cameron.moody10-mag-2007 13.35Hi Mohammed,   I'm pretty much running out of ideas now and will try anything.   I am thinking, is it a possibility that the boot rom chip needs to be replaced? Or the flash need replacing?   I have a source where I can purchase both of these. Obviously I would rather not but really just want to get a working router!Reply

xmodem copy procedurehttps://supportforums.cisco.com/people/liamwalk%40uk.ibm.com1 Reply25-nov-2003 4.06Hi,   I want to perform an xmodem copy onto a 2610 router.  Having looked at the documentation, I'm puzzled as to how the procedure works, when there is no local (PC) directory specified for the file transfer.   How does the process recognise the directory from which to copy a file from, or is there a default directory to use??Subscribe      Reply
Re: xmodem copy proceduremparekh25-nov-2003 4.06If you are using Hyperterminal to perform the transfer click on Transfer -> Send File, here you can select the file on your computer. Make sure you select the protocol as xmodem.Reply

Download IOS image of smaller size and try out once again.   Don't go for bigger Image as there is no sufficient place in flash.   Can i have series of your router.   Thanks, Satish Reply

806 IOS download via xmodem problempibuskowa4 Replies13-nov-2008 10.59Hi all,   I've got a 806 router with two problems :   ROMmon corrupt and a bad IOS for the hardware.   I've resolved the first problem (ROMmon corrupt). I've download by xmodem a new one by the command xmodem -u. Then, i'm trying to download now a good IOS image by xmodem too with the command "xmodem c806-o3sy6-mz.123-14.T7.bin" with Tera Term. When my router say :"Do not start the sending program yet... device does not contain a valid magic number dir: cannot open device "flash: WARNING: All existing data in bootflash will be lost! Invoke this application only for disaster recovery. Do you wish to continue? y/n  [n]:  y Ready to receive file c806-o3sy6-mz.123-14.T7.bin" I launch the upload with TeraTerm by : File|transfer|XMODEM|send. The control panel stay at : Packet# : 128 Bytes transfered :0% and one minute later there is a time out. I don't understand wy the ROMmon image download worked and not for the IOS. Could you help me please.   Thank you by advance.   Pierrick  Subscribe      Reply

Any idea ?Reply
Re: 806 IOS download via xmodem problemgiuslar13-nov-2008 10.35Hello Pierrick, it looks like your router thinks to be something else or you need to format the flash before trying to write over it.   I would try to format the flash from rommon   Hope to help Giuseppe  Reply
